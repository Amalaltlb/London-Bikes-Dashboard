# London Bike Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a dynamic dashboard using **Tableau** to analyze the **London bikes dataset**. The dashboard visualizes bike ride patterns, moving averages, and the impact of weather conditions (such as temperature and wind speed) on bike usage. It provides actionable insights into seasonal trends and factors influencing bike usage.

## Key Features

### 1. **Bike Usage Insights**
- Visualized total bike rides over time, showing patterns across different hours, days, and seasons.
- Incorporated moving averages to track long-term trends in bike usage.

### 2. **Weather Impact**
- Created a heat map comparing weather conditions (temperature and wind speed) with bike usage by hour, uncovering how weather influences bike rides.

### 3. **Interactive Dashboard**
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard with filters for exploring bike usage trends.
- Enabled dynamic visualizations of key metrics to allow users to explore different aspects of the data.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Tableau**: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Used for data cleaning and preparation (with pandas).
- **Excel**: Cleaned data was exported to Excel for Tableau integration.

## Users

The dashboard can be used by the following groups:

1. **City Planners and Transport Authorities**
   - **How to Use**: Monitor bike usage patterns, identify high-demand areas, and make decisions regarding bike station placements and maintenance.
   
2. **Bike-Sharing Service Providers**
   - **How to Use**: Track bike usage trends to optimize bike availability, improve service, and plan for peak usage periods, especially in relation to weather conditions.

3. **Cycling Enthusiasts or Researchers**
   - **How to Use**: Explore the data to understand how weather influences cycling behavior, and analyze bike usage trends over time for academic or personal research.

## How to Use

- **Explore the Cleaned Data**: Open the `london_bikes_final.xlsx` file to review the prepared data.
- **Load the Tableau Dashboard**: Open the `London Bikes Dashboard.twb` file using Tableau Desktop.
- **Interact with the Dashboard**: Use filters to explore different aspects of the data and explore trends in bike usage over time.

## Impact
The dashboard provides a user-friendly, interactive tool for exploring bike usage trends and the impact of weather conditions, offering valuable insights for improving bike-sharing services.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by Mo Chen, a data analyst in the financial sector. His YouTube tutorial, "Data Analyst Portfolio Project | Build an Awesome Tableau Dashboard Step by Step," guided me through the process of data exploration and dashboard creation in Tableau.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to create an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize trends in bike usage, highlighting the relationship between weather and bike rides. The dashboard offers insights that can assist in optimizing bike availability and usage patterns.
