# London Bike Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes London bike sharing data to explore usage patterns, the impact of weather conditions, and seasonal trends using **Python** (Jupyter Notebook) and **Tableau**. It involves data exploration with Python and the creation of an interactive dashboard with Tableau.

## Dataset

- **Raw Data:** `london_merged.csv` – Original unprocessed data.
- **Cleaned Data:** `london_bikes_final.xlsx` – Cleaned and structured data used for analysis.

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
  - **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
    - Used `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - Mapped numerical codes to descriptive labels for weather conditions and seasons.
    - Adjusted humidity values to actual percentages.
    - Exported cleaned data to Excel for use in Tableau.

- **Tableau**
  - **Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - Created interactive visualizations to depict bike sharing patterns.
    - Implemented filters and interactive elements for deeper insights.
  - **Dashboard Creation**
    - Built an interactive dashboard to display key metrics and trends.
    - Applied formatting techniques to enhance visual appeal.

## Key Insights & Outcomes

- **Peak Sharing Times**
  - Identified peak usage periods aligned with commuting hours and weekends.
- **Weather Impact**
  - Discovered correlations between weather conditions and bike sharing trends.
- **Seasonal Trends**
  - Observed higher sharing counts during warmer months.
- **Interactive Dashboard**
  - Developed for enhanced operational planning and decision-making.
 
## How to Use

1. **Explore the Cleaned Data:**
   - Open `london_bikes_final.xlsx` to review the prepared data.

2. **Load the Tableau Dashboard:**
   - Open `London Bikes Dashboard.twb` using **Tableau Desktop**.

3. **Interact with the Dashboard:**
   - Use filters to explore different aspects of the data.
   - Analyze trends and patterns in rental usage.
