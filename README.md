# 🚲 London Bikes Dashboard – Tableau

This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze London bike usage patterns. It highlights trends over time, the effect of weather conditions on bike usage, and seasonal behavior. The dashboard helps stakeholders make informed decisions to improve urban cycling infrastructure and optimize bike-sharing services.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The dashboard is structured into three main analysis areas:

1. **Bike Usage Insights**

   * Visualized total bike rides across hours, days, and seasons
   * Included moving averages to reveal long-term trends

2. **Weather Impact**

   * Heat map showing how temperature and wind speed correlate with bike usage by hour
   * Identifies environmental factors affecting ridership

3. **Interactive Dashboard**

   * Tableau filters enable dynamic exploration of:

     * Hourly and daily patterns
     * Temperature and wind speed conditions
     * Seasonal usage fluctuations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Bike usage peaks during morning and evening commute hours
* Usage drops significantly in cold or high-wind conditions
* Warmer temperatures generally increase bike activity, especially midday
